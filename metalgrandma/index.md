# Metal Grandma Boss Fight
### A Shitpost Game Based On An Inside Joke!!

Control a car driving around a parking lot and shoot fire at old metal grandmas!!

The joke (for people who don't know): Me and my cousin were playing a bad mobile game about cars and one of the mechanics was that you couldn't hit the grandma with the car, so we did just that, and the car went flying after hitting her, so we started calling her "Metal Grandma".
